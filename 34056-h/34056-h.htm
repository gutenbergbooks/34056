<p>The object of this publication is to afford to those who are not

of Fossil Impressions, which they might not be able to
obtain elsewhere so conveniently.</p>

<p>Some account of the Epyornis seems to be very properly connected
with Ornithichnites.</p>

<h2>THE EPYORNIS;</h2>

OR,<br><br>

GREAT BIRD OF MADAGASCAR, AND ITS EGGS.<br>
</div>


<p>In the course of the year 1851, an account was circulated
of the discovery of an immense egg, or eggs, in
the Island of Madagascar. The size of the eggs spoken
of was so disproportionate to that of any previously
known, that most persons received the account with
incredulity; and, I must confess, I was one of this
number. Being in Paris soon after hearing of this
report, I made inquiry on the subject, and was surprised
to learn, that the great egg was actually existing
in the Museum of Natural History in Paris. In
a few days I had an opportunity of seeing a cast of it
in the hands of the artist, M. Strahl, of whom I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
solicited one. He informed me that it could not be
obtained at that moment; but that, if my request were
made known to the Administration of the Museum, he
had no doubt they would accede to it. I accordingly
did apply, and also presented them with the cast of a
perfect head of Mastodon Giganteus; and they very
liberally granted my request.</p>

<p>The distinguished naturalist, Professor Geoffroy St.
Hilaire, the second of that honorable name, has made
a statement to the Academy of Sciences, which, though
only initiatory, contains many facts of a very interesting
nature, some of which I have had an opportunity
of verifying; and to him we are indebted for a greater
part of the others.</p>

<p>The eggs sent to me are, in number, two; one of
which was purchased by M. Abadie, captain of a French
vessel, from the natives. Another was soon afterwards
found, equal in size. A third egg was discovered in
an alluvial stratum near a stream of water, together
with other valuable relics of the animal which had
probably produced them; but, unfortunately, it was
broken during transportation. Of the two eggs, one
is of an ovoid form, having much the shape of a hen's
egg; and the other is an ellipsoid.</p>

<p>The ovoid egg is of enormous size, even when compared
with the largest egg we are acquainted with. Its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
long diameter exceeds thirteen inches of our English
measure, its short diameter eight, and its long circumference
thirty-three inches. Its capacity is thought to
be equal to eighteen liquid pints, or to be six times
greater than that of the largest egg known to us (the
ostrich), although but twice its length. It is said to
be equal to a hundred and forty-eight hen eggs. The
ellipsoid egg has its longest diameter somewhat less
than that of the ovoid; its short diameter nearly
equals that of the other egg, being more than eight
inches. The third egg, although broken, has been
very useful to science, by displaying the thickness of
the shell, which is about one-tenth of an inch.</p>

<p>The bones, of which I have received the casts, are
three in number, and of great interest. One of them
is a characteristic fragment of the upper part of a
fibula; the other two, still more interesting, as enabling
us to determine the class and genus of the animal to
which they belong, exhibit the extremities of the right
and left tarso-metatarsal bones. The former is somewhat
broken; the latter is nearly perfect, and exhibits
the triple division of the inferior extremity of the bone
into the three trochle&aelig; or pulley-shaped processes of
the struthious birds. It might be mistaken for a bone
of the great Dinornis, but is distinguished from this
by the flatness of the portion above the trochle&aelig;. Still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
less is it one of the bones of the ostrich, its three
pulleys being separated from each other by distinct
intervals; whereas the pulleys of the ostrich have
only one such separation, constituting two distinct
eminences.</p>

<p>M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire considered himself justified,
from these and other facts, in deciding this bone to
belong to a bird of a new genus, to which he gives
the name of <span class="smcap">Epyornis</span>, from <a name="aipys" class="greek"><i>&#945;&#7984;&#960;&#8059;&#962;</i></a>, <i>high</i>, <i>tall</i>, and <a name="ornis" class="greek"><i>&#8004;&#961;&#957;&#953;&#962;</i></a>,
<i>bird</i>; and, as probably it is a specimen of the largest
animal of the family, he affixes the specific name of
<i>maximus</i>.</p>

<p>The size of this bird, inferred from that of its egg,
would be vastly superior to that of the ostrich. But
if we notice the comparative size of the trochleated
extremity of the tarso-metatarsal bone, we shall see
that its height would be greatly exaggerated by adopting
such a basis for its establishment; in fact, it would
not probably exceed a height double that of the ostrich.
And, though it must have been superior to that of the
Dinornis maximus of Prof. Owen, it might perhaps
excel it only by the difference of two or three feet. A
bird of twelve or thirteen feet in height would, however,
if we stood in its presence, appear enormous, and
must have greatly astonished and terrified the natives
of Madagascar. Whether it now exists is uncertain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as it may possibly have a habitation in the wild recesses
of the island, which have never yet been visited by
any European traveller.</p>

<p>The credit of most of the observations and discoveries
relating to this remarkable bird is attributable
to French naturalists;<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and it seems to be a duty
devolving on English and American navigators to
complete the history thus happily begun, and to tell
us whether the Epyornis still exists in the mountain-forests
of Madagascar, or at least present us with its
extraordinary relics.</p>

<h2><a name="FOSSIL_IMPRESSIONS_I" id="FOSSIL_IMPRESSIONS_I"></a>FOSSIL IMPRESSIONS.&mdash;I.</h2>

<p>Ichnology, a newly created branch of science, takes
its name from the Greek word <a name="ichnos" class="greek"><i>&#7988;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#962; </i></a>, a <i>track</i> or <i>footstep</i>,
and the tracks themselves have been denominated Ichnites,
or, when they refer to birds only, Ornithichnites,
from <a name="ornis2" class="greek"><i>&#8004;&#961;&#957;&#953;&#962;</i></a>, a <i>bird</i>. And this last term has by custom
been generally applied to ancient impressions, though
not correctly.</p>

<p>Geology has revealed to us not only the remains of
animals and vegetables, but the impressions made by
them during their lives, and even the impressions of
unorganized bodies. The first notice of these appearances
was, as often happens, regarded with indifference
or scepticism; but their number and variety enlightened
the public mind, and opened a new source of
information and improvement.</p>

<p>The first remarkable observation made on fossil
footsteps was that of the Rev. Dr. Duncan, of Scotland,
in 1828. He noticed, in a <i>new red sandstone</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
quarry in Dumfriesshire, impressions of the feet of
small animals of the tortoise kind, having four feet,
and five toes on each foot. They were seen in various
layers through a thickness of forty feet or more.</p>

<p>Sandstone, in which these impressions are principally
discovered, is a rock composed chiefly of siliceous
and micaceous particles cemented together by calcareous
or argillaceous paste, containing salt, and colored
with various shades of the oxide of iron, particularly
the red, gray, brown. It has been remarked by Prof.
H. D. Rogers, that the perfection of the surface containing
fossil footmarks is often attributable to a
micaceous deposit. The layers of sandstone have been
formed by deposits from sea-water, dried in succession;
such layers are also seen in the roofing slate. These
deposits on the shores of the ocean, having in a soft
condition received the impressions of the feet of birds,
other animals, vegetables, and also of rain-drops,
under favorable circumstances dried, hardened, and
formed a rock of greater or less solidity. Our colleague,
Dr. Gould, has exhibited to us a specimen of
dried clay from the shores of the Bay of Fundy,
containing beautiful impressions, recently made, of
the footsteps of birds. The particles brought by the
waves, and deposited in the manner described, were
derived from the destruction of other rocks previously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
existing, particularly granite and flint, or silex, the
shining atoms of which compose no small part of
the sandstone rock.</p>

<p>It is easy to conceive, that, while these deposits were
taking place in the soft condition, portions of vegetable
matters might become intermixed; and that these, with
the impressions of the feet and other parts of animals
and unorganized substances, might be preserved by the
process of desiccation. The agency of internal heat
may have also been employed in some cases in baking
and hardening these crusty layers.</p>

<p>The sandstone rock, though in some places actually
in a state of formation at the present time, lies in such
a manner in the earth's crust as to indicate an immense
antiquity. The age of these beds varies in
different situations. The sandstone rocks which contain
the greater part of the impressions are called <i>new
red sandstone</i>, to distinguish them from the <i>old red</i>,
which is of a greater age. The deposits on Connecticut
River may not be attributed to the action of this
river, but are of higher antiquity, probably, than the
river itself, and proceeded from the waves of an ancient
sea, existing in a state of the surface of the globe very
different from that of the present day.</p>

<p>In 1834, tracks were discovered near Hildberghausen
in Saxony, to which Prof. Kaup, of Darmstadt,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
gave the name of Chirotherium, from the resemblance
to the impressions of the human hand. On a subsequent
examination, Prof. Owen preferred the name of
Labyrinthodon, from the resemblance of the folds in
the teeth to the convolutions of the brain.</p>

<p>Various other instances of impressions were seen;
and, in the year 1835, Dr. Deane and Mr. Marsh, residents
of Greenfield, noticed impressions resembling
the feet of birds in sandstone rocks of that neighborhood.
These observations having come to the knowledge
of President Hitchcock, of Amherst College,
that gentleman began a thorough investigation of the
subject, followed it up with unremitted ardor, and
has, since 1836 (the date of his first publication), laid
before the public a great amount of ichnological information,
and really created a new science. Dr. Deane,
on his part, has not been idle: besides making valuable
discoveries, he has written a number of excellent
papers to record some portion of his numerous
observations.</p>

<p>In 1837, at the request of my friend Dr. Boott, I
carried to London, for the Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons, various scientific objects peculiar
to this country; among which were a number of casts
of Ornithichnites.</p>

<p>These casts were kindly furnished me by President
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Hitchcock, and the Government of the Royal College
thereon voted to present to President Hitchcock and
Amherst College casts of the skeleton of the famous
Megatherium of South America. These casts were
packed, and sent to be embarked in a ship destined for
Boston, but were unluckily delivered to a wrong shipping
house in London, and I lost sight of them for
some time. They were at length discovered. After
remaining in this situation for more than a year, they
were sold at public auction; and, notwithstanding
many efforts on my part, I was unable to obtain and
transmit them to Amherst College.</p>

<p>The fossil impressions which have been distinguished
in various places in the new red sandstone are those of
birds, frogs, turtles, lizards, fishes, mollusca, crustacea,
worms, and zoophytes. Besides these, the impressions
made by rain-drops, ripple-marks in the sand,
coprolites or indurated remains of f&aelig;ces of animals,
and even impressions of vegetables, have been preserved
and transmitted from a remote antiquity. No
authentic human impressions have yet been established;
and none of the mammalia, except the
marsupials.(?) We must, however, remember that,
although the early paleontology contains no record of
birds, the ancient existence of these animals is now
fully ascertained. Remains of birds were discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in the Paris gypsum by Cuvier previous to 1830.
Since that time, they have been found in the Lower
Eocene in England, and the Swiss Alps; and there is
reason to believe that osseous relics may be met with
in the same deposits which contain the foot-marks.
Most of the bird-tracks which have been observed,
belong to the wading birds, or Grall&aelig;.</p>

<p>The number of toes in existing birds varies from
two to five. In the fossil bird-tracks, the most
frequent number is three, called tridactylous; but
there are instances also of four or tetradactylous, and
two or didactylous. The number of articulations
corresponds in ornithichnites with living birds: when
there are four toes, the inner or hind toe has two articulations,
the second toe three, the third toe four, the
outer toe five. The impressions of the articulations
are sometimes very distinct, and even that of the skin
covering them.</p>

<p>President Hitchcock has distinguished more than
thirty species of birds, four of lizards, three of tortoises,
and six of batrachians.</p>

<p>The great difference in the characters of many fossil
animals from those of existing genera and species, in
the opinion of Prof. Agassiz, makes it probable that
in various instances the traces of supposed birds may
be in fact traces of other animals, as, for example,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
those of the lizard or frog. And he supports this
opinion, among other reasons, by the disappearance of
the heel in a great number of Ornithichnites.</p>

<p>D'Orbigny, to whom we are indebted for the most
ample and systematic work on Paleontology ("Cours
El&eacute;mentaire de Pal&eacute;ontologie et de G&eacute;ologie," 5 vols.
1849-52), does not accept the arrangement of President
Hitchcock. He objects to the term Ornithichnites,
and proposes what he considers a more comprehensive
arrangement into organic, physiological, and
physical impressions. <i>Organic impressions</i> are those
which have been produced by the remains of organized
substances, such as vegetable impressions from
calamites, &amp;c. <i>Physiological impressions</i> are those
produced by the feet and other parts of animals.
<i>Physical impressions</i> are those from rain-drops and
ripple-marks; and to these may be added coprolites in
substance. This plan of D'Orbigny seems to exclude
the curious and interesting distinctions of groups,
genera, and species; in this way diminishing the
importance of the science of Ichnology.</p>

<p>Fossil impressions have been found on this continent
in the carboniferous strata of Nova Scotia, and
of the <a name="Alleghenies"></a><a href="#typos">Alleghenies</a>; in the sandstone of New Jersey,
and in that of the Connecticut Valley in a great
number of places, from the town of Gill in Massachusetts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to Middletown in Connecticut, a distance of
about eighty miles.</p>

<p>A slab from Turner's Falls, obtained for me by Dr.
Deane in 1845, measuring two feet by two and a half,
and two inches in thickness, contains at least ten
different sets of impressions, varying from five inches
in length to two and a half, with a proportionate
length of stride from thirteen inches to six. All these
are tridactylous, and represent at least four different
species. In most of them the distinction of articulation
is quite clear. The articulations of each toe can
readily be counted, and they are found to agree with
the general statement made above as to number. The
impressions are singularly varied as to depth; some of
them, perfectly distinct, are superficial, like those
made by the fingers laid lightly on a mass of dough,
while others are of sufficient depth nearly to bury the
toes; some of the tracks cross each other, and, being
of different sizes, belong to animals of different ages
or different species. There is one curious instance of
the tracks of a large and heavy bird, in which, from
the softness of the mud, the bird slipped in a lateral
direction, and then gained a firm footing; the mark of
the first step, though deep, is ill-defined and uncertain;
the space intervening between the tracks is superficially
furrowed; in the settled step, which is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
deepest, the toes are very strongly indicated. On the
same surface are impressions of nails, which may have
belonged to birds or chelonians.</p>

<p>The inferior surface of the same slab exhibits
appearances more superficial, less numerous, but
generally regular. There are three sets of tracks
entirely distinct from each other; two of them containing
three tracks, and one containing two,&mdash;the
latter being much the largest in size. In addition,
there is one set of tracks, which are probably those of
a tortoise. These marks present two other points
quite observable and interesting. One is that they are
displayed in relief, while those on the upper surface
are in depression. The relief in this lower surface
would be the cast of a cavity in the layer below;
so the depressions in the upper surface would be
moulds of casts above. The second point is the non-correspondence
of the upper and lower surfaces; i.e.
the depressions in the upper surface have not a general
correspondence with the elevations on its inferior surface.
The tracks above were made by different individuals
and different species from those below. This
leads to another interesting consideration, that in the
thickness of this slab there must be a number of
different layers, and in each of them there may be
a different series of tracks.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>To these last remarks there is one exception: the
deep impression in which the bird slipped in a lateral
direction corresponds with an elevation on the lower
surface, in which the impression of these toes is very
distinctly displayed, and even the articulations.
Moreover, one of the tracks on the inferior surface
interferes with the outer track in the superior, and
tends in an opposite direction, so that this last-described
footstep must have been made before the
other. It is also observable, that, while all the other
tracks are superficial, this last penetrates the whole
thickness of the slab; thus showing that the different
deposits continued some time in a soft state.</p>

<p>On the surfaces of this slab, particularly on the
upper, there are various marks besides those of the
feet, some of which seem to have been made by straws,
or portions of grass, or sticks; and there is a curved
line some inches in length, which seems to have arisen
from shrinkage.</p>

<p>In the collection of Mr. Marsh,<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> there were two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
slabs of great size, each measuring ten by six feet,
having a great number of impressions of feet, and
about the same thickness as the slab under examination.
One of these presented depressions; and the
other, corresponding reliefs. These very interesting
relations were necessarily parted in the sale of Mr.
Marsh's collection; one of them being obtained for
the Boston Society of Natural History, and the other
for the collection of Amherst College.</p>

<p>The <i>Physical Impressions</i>, according to Professor
D'Orbigny, are of three kinds, viz.: 1st, Rain-drops;
2d, Ripple-marks; and 3d, Coprolites. I have a slab
which exhibits two leptodactylous tracks very distinct,
about an inch and a half long, surrounded by impressions
of rain-drops and ripple-marks. Another specimen
exhibits the impressions of rain in a more distinct
and remarkable manner. The imprints are of various
sizes, from those which might be made by a common
pea to others four times its diameter; some are deep,
others superficial and almost imperceptible. They are
generally circular, but some are ovoid. Some have the
edge equally raised around, as if struck by a perpendicular
drop; and others have the edge on one part
faintly developed, while another part is very sharp and
well defined, as if the drop had struck obliquely. It
has been suggested, that these fossil rain-drops may

have been made by particles of hail; but I think the
variety of size and depth of depression would have
been more considerable if thus made.</p>

<p>Although we have necessarily treated the subject of
fossil footmarks in a very brief way, sufficient has
been said to show that this new branch of Paleontology
may lead to interesting results. The fact that
they are, in some manner, peculiar to this region,
seems to call upon our Society to obtain a sufficient
number of specimens to exhibit to scientific men a
fair representation of the condition of Ichnology in
this quarter of our country; and we have therefore
great reason to congratulate ourselves, that, through
the vigilance and spirit of our members, the Society
has the expectation of obtaining a rich collection
of ichnological specimens.</p>

<h2>FOSSIL IMPRESSIONS.&mdash;II.</h2>

<p>Since writing the preceding article, I have been able
to obtain, through the kindness of President Hitchcock,
a number of additional specimens of fossil
impressions. By the aid of these, I may hope to give
an idea of the system of impressions, so far as it has
been discovered, without, however, attempting to enter
into minute details. For these, I would refer to the
account of the "Geology of Massachusetts," by President
Hitchcock; to his valuable article published in
the "Memoirs of the American Academy;" and to his
geological works generally.</p>

<p>The numerous tracks which have been assembled
together in the neighborhood of Connecticut River
have afforded an opportunity of prosecuting these
studies to an extent unusual in the primitive rocky
soil of New England. These appearances are not,
indeed, wholly new. Such traces had been previously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
met with in other countries; but, in their number and
variety, the valley of the Connecticut abounds above
all places hitherto investigated.</p>

<p>Twenty years have elapsed since the study of Ichnology
has been prosecuted in this country; and, in this
period of time, about forty-nine species of animal
tracks have been distinguished in the locality mentioned,
according to President Hitchcock; which have
been regularly arranged by him in groups, genera, and
species.</p>

<p>I propose now to lay the specimens, recently
obtained, before the Society, as a slight preparation
for the more numerous and more valuable articles
which they are soon to receive.</p>

<p>The traces found on ancient rocks, as has been
shown in the previous article, are those of animals,
vegetables, and unorganized substances. The traces
of animals are produced by quadrupeds, birds, lizards,
turtles, frogs, mollusca, worms, crustacea, and zoophytes.
These impressions are of various forms:
some of them simple excavations; some lines, either
straight or curved, and others complicated into various
figures.</p>

<p>President Hitchcock has based his distinctions of
fossil animal impressions on the following characters,
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<div class="smaller">
<ol>
<li>Toes thick, pachydactylous; or thin, leptodactylous.<br>
<li>Feet winged.<br>
<li>Number of toes from two to five, inclusive.<br>
<li>Absolute and relative length of the toes.<br>
<li>Divarication of the lateral toes.<br>
<li>Angle made by the inner and middle, outer and middle toes.<br>
<li>Projection of the middle beyond the lateral toes.<br>
<li>Distance between tips of lateral toes.<br>
<li>Distance between tips of middle and inner and outer toes.<br>
<li>Position and direction of hind toe.<br>
<li>Character of claw.<br>
<li>Width of toes.<br>
<li>Number and length of phalangeal expansions.<br>
<li>Character of the heel.<br>
<li>Irregularities of under side of foot.<br>
<li>Versed sine of curvature of toes.<br>
<li>Angle of axis of foot with line of direction.<br>
<li>Distance of posterior part of the foot from line of direction.<br>
<li>Length of step.<br>
<li>Size of foot.<br>
<li>Character of the integuments of the foot.<br>
<li>Coprolites.<br>
<li>Means of distinguishing bipedal from quadrupedal tracks.<br>
</ol>
</div>

<p>By these characters, President Hitchcock has distinguished
physiological tracks, or those made by
animated beings, into ten groups provisionally. To
these may be added, "organic impressions," made
by organized bodies; and the impressions made by
inanimate bodies, called "physical impressions."</p>

<p>The specimens under our hands enable us to give
some notion of the distinctions which characterize the
greater part of these groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="center">
<h3>GROUP FIRST&mdash;STRUTHIONES.</h3>
</div>

<p>The ostrich-tracks present a numerous natural
and most remarkable group; remarkable from the
great size of some species,&mdash;all of them tridactylous
and pachydactylous. The ostrich of the Old World
has only two toes, but this family exists in South
America at the present time under the name of Rhea
Americana; and tracks of an animal, probably of the
same family, are found in the numerous impressions
near Connecticut River,&mdash;all of them having three
toes in front, and the rudiment of a fourth behind.</p>

<p>This group contains a number of genera. The
<span class="smcap">First Genus</span>, denominated <i>Brontozoum</i>, presents the
tracks of a most extraordinary bird. These tracks
appear less questionable since the discovery in Madagascar
of the eggs of the Epyornis.</p>

<p>The tracks of the largest species, the <span class="smcap">Brontozoum
Giganteum</span>, are four times the magnitude of those
made by the existing ostrich of Africa. They are
very numerous, and congregated together. The foot
of the Brontozoum Giganteum, including the inferior
extremity of the tarso-metatarsal bone, which makes
a part of the foot, measures in our specimen twenty
inches; in the <a name="comma"></a><a href="#typos">Mastodon Giganteus,</a> the foot measures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
twenty-seven inches; the width also is less, being
ten inches across the metacarpals, while that of the
Mastodon is twenty-two: but the one is a bird, the
other a quadruped. The toes are three in number,
and present the same divisions with existing birds;
the inner toe having three, the middle four, the outer
five phalanges. Some of the articulations of the toes
of this noble specimen are remarkable for the manner
in which they illustrate the mode of formation of the
tracks. These phalanges have become separated from
the solid rock in which they were encased, so as to be
removable at pleasure; and they thus show that the
whole foot is not a simple impression in the rock
which contains it, but a depression filled by foreign
materials, i.e. by sand, clay, and other relics of
pre-existing rocks. These materials had been gradually
deposited in the mould formed by the bird's foot, and
are therefore independent of this rock, in the same
way as the plaster-of-Paris cast of a tooth, or any
other body, is independent of the mould to which it
owes its form. The impressions are in gray sandstone.</p>

<p>On the reversed surface of the slab is seen a small
piece of broken quartz, about half an inch square.
This piece forms a beautiful illustration of a part
of the process by which the sandstone rocks are
formed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The second species of the same genus is the <span class="smcap">Brontozoum
Sillimanium</span>. Of this we have three specimens;
the tracks have the same general character
with the preceding, but are smaller.</p>

<p>The third species of this genus is styled the <span class="smcap">Brontozoum
Loxonyx</span>, from <a name="loxos" class="greek"><i>&#955;&#959;&#958;&#8056;&#962;</i></a>, a <i>bow</i>, and <a name="onyx" class="greek"><i>&#8004;&#957;&#965;&#958;</i></a>, a <i>nail</i>,&mdash;a
curved nail. It is smaller than the Sillimanium,
and has the nail set to one side.</p>

<p>The fourth species, still smaller, is the <span class="smcap">Brontozoum
Gracillimum</span>. On this slab the impressions are in
relief; viz.: 1st, of Brontozoum Gracillimum; 2d, of
Brontozoum Parallelum; 3d, of the track of a tortoise,
fourteen inches long, and two wide. Other extensive
eminences and depressions, with rain-drops,
may be observed on the same surface.</p>

<p>The fifth species is called <span class="smcap">Brontozoum Parallelum</span>,
from the tracks being on a line with each other. Of
this there are two specimens, one of them, however,
being a single track. On the surface of the other
slab there are at least five distinct tracks, one of them
being a small new and undescribed species,&mdash;thus
making the whole number of species of Brontozoum
which we possess to be at least six.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Second Genus</span> of Struthiones is called <i>&AElig;thyopus</i>,
from <a name="aithuia" class="greek"><i>&#945;&#7988;&#952;&#965;&#953;&#945;</i></a>, a <i>gull</i>, and <a name="pous" class="greek"><i>&#960;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</i></a>, a <i>foot</i>,&mdash;gull-footed.
This genus is smaller than the Brontozoum Giganteum;
and we have two species, viz. the <span class="smcap">&AElig;thyopus
Lyellianus</span>, which is the larger, and two specimens
of <span class="smcap">&AElig;thyopus Minor</span>. All of these are distinguished
from the preceding genus by the winged foot, and in
the Lyellianus by the shallowness of the impression.
The &AElig;thyopus Minor is not always distinguished by
the superficiality of its impression. This is sometimes
deep. Therefore this character may not be considered
a distinctive one, or the &AElig;thyopus Minor might be
referred to another genus. Of the two specimens of
this latter species, the first is in depression, tridactylous.
The depressions are deep with rain-drops,
marks of quadrupeds and zoophytes over the whole
surface. The ornithichnic impressions are two in
number; one superficial, the other very deep. The
reversed surface of this slab contains one tridactylous
impression in relief. The second specimen has three
depressions; two of which are superficial, and the
third is quite deep, displaying, by a depressed surface,
the webbed character of the foot.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<h3>GROUP SECOND.</h3>

<p>We shall take, to characterize this group, the
<i>Argozoum</i>, from <a name="arges" class="greek"><i>&#7936;&#961;&#947;&#8052;&#962;</i></a>, <i>swift</i>, <i>winged</i>.</p>

<p>Of this genus there are two species, the larger of
which is the <span class="smcap">Argozoum Disparidigitatum</span>. It is
leptodactylous, and remarkable for the length of the
middle toe. We have another species, which is
smaller than the last named, and in which the toes
are nearly of equal length; hence called <span class="smcap">Argozoum
Paridigitatum</span>.</p>

<p>The other genus of this group is the <span class="smcap">Platypterna</span>,
and our specimen is named <i>Deaniana</i>. This genus is
remarkable for the width of the heel; hence the
name, from <a name="platys" class="greek"><i>&#960;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#8058;&#962;</i></a>, <i>broad</i>, and <a name="pterna" class="greek"><i>&#960;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#957;&#951;</i></a>, <i>a heel</i>. It has three
toes like the other genera of this group.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;">

<h3>GROUP THIRD.</h3>

<p>This and the succeeding group are tetradactylous;
having one toe behind, three forwards.</p>

<p>The third group is leptodactylous; foot usually
small, but sometimes of medium size. Of it we have
two specimens, viz.: <span class="smcap">Ornithopus Gallinaceus</span>, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Ornithopus Gracilis</span>. The former is so called from
the resemblance to the domestic fowl: for convenience
sake, in this and other instances, we use the whole for
a part. It is about three inches in length, and the
Ornithopus Gracilis about two.</p>

<p>This latter specimen is particularly interesting. It
consists of two parts, which open like the covers of a
book. These covers present four impressions: first,
the superficial, which is distinct, slender, and beautiful&mdash;the
heel is broad; second, corresponding with
this depression and on the inside, is a figure in relief
as distinct as the depression; third, on the inside of
the second cover is a depression corresponding with
the relief last mentioned; fourth, on the outer side is
a second relief corresponding with the second depression,
but less distinct than either of the other three,
still, however, exhibiting three toes pointing anteriorly,
but the hind toe is wanting. The whole of this
double slab forms a series of cameos and intaglios,
measuring four inches by three, and in thickness an
inch and a quarter.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;">

<h3>GROUP FOURTH.</h3>

<p>Of the fourth group we have five specimens. The
<i>Tri&aelig;nopus</i>, so called from its resemblance to a trident,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
has besides three leptodactylous toes pointing forwards,
a fourth extending backwards in a remarkable
way, like the handle of a trident; the impression,
however, being expanded so as to show an extensive
displacement of the mud. All the specimens of
Tri&aelig;nopus are in a beautiful red shale, very thin and
fragile, but presenting well-defined impressions, generally
about three inches long.</p>

<p>There are two species to this genus. Of the
<span class="smcap">Tri&aelig;nopus Emmonsianus</span> we notice three impressions
in relief. In another specimen there is the appearance
of a part of the toes of the Anom&#339;pus Scambus, and
on the upper side are seen two excavations corresponding
with the three impressions. In the last slab, the
track of the <span class="smcap">Tri&aelig;nopus Baileyanus</span> appears to have
been made by two feet placed successively in the same
spot, which led President Hitchcock to suspect it
might have been made by a quadruped. One of the
specimens has the Tri&aelig;nopus tracks intermixed in a
peculiar way with other impressions.</p>

<p>The specimen representing the genus <span class="smcap">Harpedactylus</span>
is larger than the preceding; and, though
leptodactylous, the toes are much broader and also
more curved, whence the name Harpedactylus, <i>sickle-finger</i>,
from <a name="harpe" class="greek"><i>&#7941;&#961;&#960;&#951;</i></a> and <a name="daktylos" class="greek"><i>&#948;&#8049;&#954;&#964;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962;</i></a>.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<h3>GROUP FIFTH.</h3>

<p>The fifth group differs much from the four previous
ones. In this and the following groups we pass from
the vestiges of birds to those of other animals, some
of which are bipeds, some quadrupeds. Many impressions
are without any distinct character, belonging
probably to the lower animals, to vegetables, and
unorganized bodies.</p>

<p>The fifth group comprehends the tracks of an extraordinary
animal, the <span class="smcap">Otozoum</span>.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> The name which
has been given to it is taken from that of an ancient
giant, Otus, who with his brother Ephialtes, according
to heathen mythology, made war with the gods.
These fabled giants were, at nine years of age, nine
cubits in width and nine fathoms in height.</p>

<p>The foot is divided into four toes; the two outer of
which seem to be connected by a common basis. The
inner toe has three phalanges; the second toe, also
three; the third and fourth toes, four each. The first is
the shortest, the second longer, the third longest, the
fourth shorter than the third. It will appear, then,
that this track differs from that of birds in the number
of toes pointing forwards; these being four, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in birds the forward toes are only three. There is a
difference also in the number and arrangement of the
articulations.</p>

<p>The track in our possession is twenty inches long
by thirteen and a half inches broad. The rock in
which it is imbedded is a dark-colored sandstone.
President Hitchcock has a slab showing a regular
series of tracks of this animal; the distance between
the steps being about three feet, and the tracks equidistant
and alternate, which would not be the case
if the animal had been quadrupedal. In a quadruped,
the horse for example, the hind feet are set down near
the fore feet, and sometimes even strike them. Hence
it must be inferred that the track in question was
that of a biped, or of a quadruped which did not use
its fore feet in progression, like a kangaroo. We
naturally ask, What kind of biped could this have
been? Evidently not a man, the size of the foot being
too large to admit such a supposition; nor could it
have been a bird, the number of toes and their direction
not admitting this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Tetradactylous birds, or those which have four
toes, have only three of them directed forwards, and
the fourth backwards, generally. There are, however,
exceptions; some birds have four toes directed forwards:
this is the fact with the Hirundo Cypselus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and the Pelicanus Aquilus of Linn&aelig;us, or Man-of-war
Bird. But the articulations are different in the two
animals, birds having regularly two, three, four, and
five phalanges, and the spur, where it exists, supported
by a single osseous phalanx; whereas the Otozoum has
three phalanges in the inner and second toe, four in
the third and fourth toes. In this last arrangement,
the Otozoum is decidedly different from all known
birds. It is not likely to have been a tortoise or
a lizard. The kangaroo has four feet, and uses
only two in progression, moving forward by leaps;
also, like the Otozoum, it has four toes; but the
size of the toes does not accord with that of the
Otozoum, nor is the structure of the foot the same,
so far as we know. It has been suggested by
Professor Agassiz, that this animal might have been
a two-footed frog. Nature had, in those days, animal
forms different from those we are acquainted with;
and this might have been the fact with the Otozoum.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;">

<h3>GROUP SIXTH.</h3>

<p>We have in this group a specimen of the track of a
four-footed animal, which may have been a frog, though
different from ours. The feet are unequal in size, and
present a different number of toes. In existing frogs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
there are four toes in the fore feet, and five in the
hind; but, in the specimen before us, the front toes are
five in number, and the back toes three. It is called,
therefore, <span class="smcap">Anom&#339;pus</span>, <i>unequal-footed</i>. These impressions
are in the red shale of Hadley, and very distinct.
In some of them the lower leg is indicated, forming
an impression six or seven inches long. The feet being
smaller than the legs, the impression made by the
latter is more expanded, superficial, and broader, yet
still very definite. The opinion of President Hitchcock
and Dr. Deane is, that the different impressions
of five and three toes are those of the anterior and
posterior extremities of one animal, which, from the
size of the limbs, might be a frog three feet high.</p>

<p>On the same schist with these footmarks, are other
curious impressions. The back of the slab is almost
covered with the imprints of rain-drops. In the midst
of these is a tridactylous impression, probably of a
quadruped, crossed at its root by a single depression,
nearly an inch broad, and two and a half long: this
seems to form part of another broad superficial impression
of about seven by four inches, which is
probably also quadrupedal. Other parts present the
impressions of nails and worm-tracks. At the opposite
end is a deep, smooth, regular excavation, which
might have been made by a Medusa.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<h3>GROUP SEVENTH.</h3>

<p>The seventh group contains the impressions of the
feet of Saurians or lizards. We have a specimen of
quadrupedal marks, with five toes to each foot, about
an inch long, which may have been made by these
animals. The impressions are small, but very distinct.
There are lizards of the present day with five toes,
about the size of these impressions; and these may,
therefore, be set down as belonging to this order of
reptiles. Like a number of the last-named specimens,
they are in red shale.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;">

<h3>GROUP EIGHTH.</h3>

<p>The eighth group is assigned by President Hitchcock
to the Chelonian or turtle tribe. The slab bearing
impressions of Brontozoum Gracillimum has a
mark about fourteen inches long and two wide, which
may be attributed to the plastron or breast-plate of the
tortoise. On the slab from Turner's Falls there is a
longitudinal furrow, which might have been made by
the tail of a turtle; and in various of our slabs are
impressions which we think belong to this tribe. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
shall have occasion to notice hereafter remarkable
tracks of these animals in the old red of Morayshire,
in Scotland.</p>

<p>The most distinct of the traces of chelonians are
on the large slab lately obtained for me by President
Hitchcock from Greenfield. (<a href="#Page_slab"><i>Vide</i> Plate.</a>) This interesting
slab contains the traces of quadrupeds,
various birds, and two trails of chelonians: the largest
of these is nearly five feet long, and four inches in
diameter. The trail is composed of a number of
parallel elevations, comparatively superficial.</p>

<hr style="width:25%;">

<h3>GROUP NINTH.</h3>

<p>Of the ninth group, containing the marks of Annelid&aelig;,
Crustacea, and Zoophytes, we have various
specimens.</p>

<p>The impressions of insects do not seem as yet to
have been distinguished on the ancient rocks. There
is reason to believe, however, that many of the marks
we discover in the rocky beds might have been made
by the feet and bodies of large insects; and small
species of the same tribes have been found imbedded
in, and actually constituting, immense masses of calcareous
and siliceous rocks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The tracks of worms are numerous. No doubt
these worms drew together a concourse of birds to the
shores on which they rolled. On various slabs we
find long cylindrical furrows, about the eighth of an
inch in diameter, and of different lengths; one of
them, in the slab from Dr. Deane, being eight or nine
inches long. To these impressions the name of <span class="smcap">Herpystezoum</span>,
from <a name="herpystes" class="greek"><i>&#7953;&#961;&#960;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8052;&#962;</i></a>, <i>crawling</i>, has been given.
They vary, however, and some of them are very likely
to be the tracks of the common earth-worm, or of
some species of worm which existed when these rocks
were formed. These impressions vary in length and
in diameter; some of them are moderately regular,
and others irregularly curved.</p>

<p>Very interesting tracks have been found in the
ancient Potsdam white sandstone of Beauharnais, on
the St. Lawrence, by Mr. Logan, an excellent geologist
of Canada, and determined by Professor Owen to
belong to Crustacea, crabs. The number of impressions
made by each foot is sometimes seven, sometimes
eight, and even more. This track, showing the traces
of Crustacea, goes to form another link in the chain of
fossil footsteps.</p>

<p>The Medus&aelig;, commonly called jelly-fish, dissolving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
as they do under the influence of the sun and air,
would hardly be expected to leave their traces impressed
on ancient rocks. Professor D'Orbigny, however,
has watched the dissolution of these animals on
the sea-shore, and found that, after wasting, they may
leave their impressions on the sand; which, not being
disturbed by a high tide for nearly a month, retains
the impression of the zoophyte, and serves as a mould
to receive materials which take a cast and transmit it
to subsequent ages. We find one of these impressions
on the slab of the Anom&#339;pus Scambus; and President
Hitchcock, having examined it, is of opinion that it
retains the traces of a Medusa. The impression is
about five inches in diameter, of a darker color and
smoother texture than the rest of the rock. Its edges
fade away gradually in the surface of the subjacent
sandstone. A similar impression is found on the
superior surface of the slab containing the Argozoum.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" >

<h3>GROUP TENTH.</h3>

<p>The tenth group contains the <span class="smcap">Harpagopus</span>, a name
derived from <a name="harpage" class="greek"><i>&#7937;&#961;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#8052;</i></a>, <i>seizure</i>, <i>rapine</i>. It is represented
by President Hitchcock as having the form of a drag.
The figure given by him resembles in a degree the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
foot of the African ostrich; being a long thick toe,
with a shorter one, not unlike a thumb, on the side.
An impression approximating this, but of small size,
may be seen on the slab of the Anom&#339;pus Scambus.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" >

<p>The formation of bird-tracks is well represented by
a clay specimen, about an inch thick, and ten inches
long. This is a piece of dried clay, obtained by President
Hitchcock from the banks of the Connecticut,
and produced by washings from clay on the shore
above, covered with foot-impressions of a small tridactylous
bird, and dried in the sun. This piece shows,
in a way not to be questioned, the manner in which
the ancient vestiges were produced. Sir Charles Lyell
noticed a similar fact on the banks of the Bay of
Fundy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="ORGANIC_IMPRESSIONS" id="ORGANIC_IMPRESSIONS"></a>ORGANIC IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

<p>The <i>second</i> great division of fossil impressions
is called <span class="smcap">Organic</span>, meaning impressions made by
organized bodies; the bones of animals, fishes, and
vegetables.</p>

<p>Near one extremity of the slab of the Ornithopus
Gallinaceus is an elevation, about a foot long, and
between one and two inches wide, projecting from the
surface nearly half an inch. It has the appearance of
a round bar of iron imbedded in the rock, which is
clayey sandstone. This apparent bar of iron was
probably a bone, buried in the stone, now silicified
and impregnated with iron; the animal matter having
entirely disappeared. In the slab of the Brontozoum
Sillimanium is a projection about seven or eight inches
long, and half an inch wide; probably the bone of
an animal, perhaps a clavicle of the Brontozoum
Giganteum.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
The vestiges of fishes are very numerous in the
sandstone rocks of Connecticut River. We have not
less than two dozen specimens from this locality; a
number equal to all the other specimens in our collection.
These impressions of fishes are generally from
three to six inches long, and three or four inches
wide. They are of the grand division denominated by
Professor Agassiz "heterocercal," having their tails
unequally bilobed, from the partial prolongation of
the dorsal spine; and they are considered to be of
lower antiquity than the fishes which are entirely heterocercal.
The most remarkable of the fish-specimens
in our collection is a <span class="smcap">Cephalaspis</span> (?): this fish is found
in the specimen containing tracks of the Brontozoum
Gracillimum, and traces of a turtle or tortoise. This
fossil was discovered in the upper layer of the old red
sandstone of Scotland, and had been mistaken by
some for a trilobite: to us it appeared to be a Limulus,
but further observation leads us to believe it to be
a <i>Cephalaspis</i>. It exhibits a convex disc, four inches
across, by two inches from above downwards, and a
tail at right angles with the disc, the uncovered part
of which is three inches long. The animal has been
described by Professor Agassiz as being composed of a
strong buckler, with a pointed horn at either termination
of the crescent, and an angular tail.</p>

To the vegetable impressions discovered among the
sandstone rocks a peculiar name has not yet been
assigned. When, however, we consider the strong
probability that many impressions of stalks, leaves,
fruits, and other parts of vegetables, may be hereafter
discovered in these rocks, it will be found convenient
to have a distinctive denomination. Vast numbers of
vegetable impressions of a distinct and beautiful appearance,
and in great variety, have been found in the
coal-formation, which is nearly allied to the sandstone:
such are the Sigillaria, Stigmaria, Equisetace&aelig;, Lycopodiace&aelig;,
Conifer&aelig;, Cycade&aelig;, &amp;c. It is sufficient to
say that the number of these has been already swelled
to many hundreds: we must also believe, that some of
the impressions in sandstone rocks which have been
assigned to other substances ought to be attributed to
vegetables. We may, therefore, venture to call the
vegetable impressions "phytological."</p>

<p>A number of our slabs bear impressions of vegetables;
either twigs of trees, or spires of plants. In a
fragment broken from one of the toes of the Brontozoum
Giganteum, we see a cylindrical depression,
three inches long, and half an inch in diameter,
marked by transverse lines, about the sixth of an inch
apart, and presenting an unquestionable appearance
of a fragment of a twig of an ancient vegetable,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which had been trodden under the foot of the mighty
Brontozoum. On the reversed surface of the same
slab are found impressions, which were produced by a
number of fragments of sticks, five or six inches long,
lying at right angles, or nearly so. One of these
sticks has been broken, and its pieces are slightly
displaced from each other. Various other specimens
contain the marks of sticks, or twigs of trees. The
stri&aelig;, so distinctly discernable in a number of these
portions, having been compared with twigs of the
existing conifer&aelig; (?), were found to resemble them.
Some of these sticks show the appearance of incipient
carbonization; yet the rock is sandstone, presenting,
as already mentioned, distinct appearances of quartz,
and other substances of which the arenaceous rocks
are composed.</p>

<h2><a name="PHYSICAL_IMPRESSIONS" id="PHYSICAL_IMPRESSIONS"></a>PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS.</h2>


<p>The <i>third</i> great division of impressions in the
sandstone rocks is called <span class="smcap">Physical</span>, meaning those
made by inanimate and unorganized substances; such
are rain-drops, ripple-marks, and coprolites.</p>

<p>1. Marks of rain-drops, described on page 20,
appear to be quite common. We have two or three
specimens in relief, and as many in depression. They
occur as follows: 1st, on the upper surface of the
slab first described; 2d, on that of the Platypterna;
3d, on that of the &AElig;thyopus Lyellianus; 4th, on that
of the Brontozoum Gracillimum; 5th, on that of the
&AElig;thyopus Minor; 6th, on that of the Anom&#339;pus
Scambus; 7th, on the recent clay; also in one small
hand-specimen, and in a second containing two fishes.
They show that, in those ancient periods when the
Brontozoum Giganteum and the Otozoum resided in
these parts, showers were frequent, and probably
abundant for the supply of the wants and the gratification
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the appetites of these animals, then common,
but which now appear to us so extraordinary.</p>

<p>2. Ripple-marks are seen in a number of these
pieces; for example, on the slab first described, on
the Brontozoum Sillimanium slab, on the Brontozoum
Gracillimum slab, on one of the Tri&aelig;nopus, and on
the upper surface of the Greenfield slab. These
marks are represented by parallel curves, or straight
lines, distant from each other from half an inch to
an inch, and presenting a slight degree of prominence.
There is another form of ripple-marks(?), differing
from those above described. These are of a circular
and mammillary form: they are strewed thickly, like
little islets, approximating to each other. They are
seen distinctly on one of the slabs of the Brontozoum
Sillimanium, on that of the &AElig;thyopus Lyellianus,
and some others. Whether they are to be considered
as accumulations of sand and clay, formed by the
action of the sea, we are uncertain; but there seems
to be no other cause to which they can be assigned
with so great probability.</p>

<p>3. <i>Coprolites</i>, the fossilized ejections of animals, are
intermixed with other animal vestiges in the sandstone
of Connecticut River, and afford additional proof of
the former existence of animals about these rocks.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The latest accounts of fossil footprints we have had
occasion to notice are those of the Crustacea, already
mentioned, as found in Canada, and of the Chelonian
in Scotland. The Canadian impressions, called by
Professor Owen Protichnites, were discovered in the
year 1847, and were laid before the London Geological
Society in 1851. The most remarkable circumstance
about them was their existence, as already stated, in
a white sandstone, near the banks of the River St.
Lawrence, at Beauharnais. This sandstone, which has
been described by New York geologists under the
name of Potsdam, is thought to belong to the Silurian
system, and to have a higher antiquity than even the
"old red."</p>

<p>The Scotch footsteps are situated in the old red
sandstone, and are those of a Chelonian. So that we
have now two series of tracks, the Crustacea in Canada
and the Chelonian in Scotland, of higher antiquity
than any which had been previously discovered.</p>

<p>On a review of the labors of President Hitchcock,
we are struck with admiration at the immense details
that, in the midst of arduous official and literary
duties, he has been able to go through with in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
period since the foot-tracks were discovered on Connecticut
River. Although his labors should be modified
by succeeding observers, Science must be ever
grateful to him for laying the foundation, and doing
so much for the completion, of a work so great, novel,
and interesting.</p>

<p>This inquiry seems to us to promise a rich variety;
and we hope that President Hitchcock and other
observers will continue to explore and cultivate it
with undiminished zeal.</p>

<h3><a name="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_PLATE" id="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_PLATE"></a>DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATE.</h3>

<p>We are indebted to Photography for enabling us to
represent the <a href="#Page_slab">remarkable slab</a> from Greenfield, and its
numerous objects, in a small space, yet with perfect
accuracy. This slab is four feet seven and one-half
inches in one direction, and four feet one inch transversely
to this; in thickness it measures about an
inch. It is composed of gray sandstone, in which
the micaceous element is conspicuous, and contains
many interesting impressions on both surfaces.</p>

<p>The most interesting surface is the inferior; and
the objects are, of course, presented in relief. They
are, first, two Chelonian tracks; second, four sets of
bird-tracks; third, footsteps of an unknown animal.
The <i>Chelonian tracks</i> are two in number: the longest
measures four feet ten inches; the shorter, two feet
nine inches. Both of these impressions are made
apparently by the plastron of the turtle. They are
from four to eight inches in width, and composed of
elevated stri&aelig;. These stri&aelig; are formed by raised lines,
pursuing a course generally regular, but accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with some inflections: they are, as the plate represents,
very distinct. The shorter track appeared to
me to be crossed by another; but the photographic
impression, though only a few inches long, enabled
me to ascertain that this appearance was produced by
bird-tracks above and below.</p>

<p>The <i>bird-tracks</i> are all tridactylous. The first set
lies above and to the right of the shorter turtle-track,
and is composed of only two steps, proceeding in the
course of the plate downwards. The second set of
bird-tracks has five impressions, extending from the
right superior pointed angle of the slab across the
small turtle-track to the larger, in which it is lost.
The third set of bird-tracks begins by an impression
larger than any other on the piece at the left extremity
of the longer turtle-track; and the remainder,
three in number, descending towards the right, are
the least distinct of any. The fourth set of bird-tracks
begins below the longer turtle-track, and ascends by
four impressions, crossing the track till it meets the
first.</p>

<p>The most curious track, consisting of six digitated
impressions, still remains. The first is seen on the
left of the longer turtle-track, near the largest bird-track;
the second is on the track; the third is above
the track; the others cross the slab by fainter impressions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Each of them is composed by two feet, and
each foot contains four toes, which are seen more
distinctly in some impressions than in others. The
largest of these double tracks is about three inches in
diameter. Perhaps it would be useless to speculate
upon what kind of animal they were made by.
There is a similarity between these and the tracks of
the Anom&#339;pus Scambus, spoken of in the sixth
group. In the latter, however, the toes are five and
three. Some experienced persons think they are
tracks of the mink, Mustela Lutreola, an animal common
at the present day in these parts. This has five
toes; but it may be in this as in some other digitigrades,
that one of the toes in each foot does not
make an impression; or perhaps it is safer to believe,
till further investigation is made, that it was an animal
of a construction not now existing.</p>

<p>The direction of these tracks presents a puzzle we
are not able to unravel; it exhibits the impressions
of four toes, and we have supposed it might possess
five. In either of these cases, we have no right to
consider it a bird-track, but probably a reptile or a
mammal. Admitting this to be the fact, we are
unable to account for the direction of the steps, which
is not alternate, as in the quadruped, but in straight
lines. In other words, this animal, supposed to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
four legs, gives us the impressions of two only, and
both of these placed together.</p>

<p>When the tridactylous tracks are attentively considered,
compared with each other, and with the
digitated tracks, they appear to exhibit the character
of the impressions of the feet of birds so very
decidedly, that it would require something more than
a philosophic incredulity to question their ornithic
origin.</p>

<p>The other side of this slab contains interesting
impressions. In the first place, this surface is covered
with ripple-marks, each about two inches broad,
extending with various degrees of distinctness across
the slab, and having an interval of an inch. The
width of the ridges is greater than in any of the
specimens we have seen.</p>

<p>This surface is almost covered by rain-drops. It
has also, among other impressions, one which has
been drawn by Mr. Silsbee, our photographist, and
represented by the figure below of its proper size.
This figure, nearly four and a half inches in length,
is an exact resemblance in form, but not in size, of
the great Otozoum, as depicted by President Hitchcock,
and shown by the actual impression, in our
hands, of the great foot, twenty inches long, and of
proportionate breadth. The form of the heel, or posterior
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
part of the foot, is the same in the two figures;
the toes are equal in both, viz. four in number; the
two internal toes correspond in their articulations,
and the two external are nearly alike, with a little
allowance for a different amount of adipose texture.
Whether this was the impression of an infant Otozoum,
I pretend not to determine: the drawing was
taken by a gentleman who knew nothing of the
Otozoum. There are similar impressions, smaller
than that last described, on the same surface.</p>

<p>The stone, though now very hard and intractable,
having resisted all the chemical agents we could
employ, must have remained in a soft state for some
time; for the impressions of the foot shown below
penetrate to the opposite surface.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In this description we have not attempted to
point out all the objects worthy of interest on both
sides of this curious slab. Every part of it is full
of interest, and presents a field for protracted observations.
The surface represented in the plate may,
by the aid of a magnifier, be studied without the
presence of the stone itself; for the photographic art
displays the most minute objects without alteration
or omission.</P>
